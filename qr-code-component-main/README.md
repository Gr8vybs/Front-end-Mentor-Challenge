### What I learned

I learnt how to use flex box to arrange structures in my HTML easily.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

````css
.qr-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue working on my css skills, specifically in the areas of flex-box, css grid, Responsive webpage design e.t.c.
